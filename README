----------------------------------------------------------------------

febootstrap is a tool for building supermin appliances.  These are
tiny appliances [similar to virtual machines], usually around 100KB in
size, which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a
second when you need to boot one of them.

A complete description is in the febootstrap(8) man page.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF FEBOOTSTRAP 2.x:
  febootstrap 3.x is a complete rewrite.  febootstrap 2.x could only
  build Fedora distributions.  This version can build many varieties
  of Linux distros.  3.x only builds supermin appliances, it does not
  build chroots.  3.x does not build cross-distro, cross-release or
  cross-architecture systems.  If you want febootstrap 2.x, please use
  the 'febootstrap-2.x' branch from the git repository.

Requirements
------------

  ocaml

  ocaml findlib ("ocamlfind" program)

  perldoc
    - This is just used to generate the manpage.

  bash

  gcc

  qemu
    - Only if you need to test-boot appliances.

  libext2fs
  /sbin/mke2fs
    - These are part of e2fsprogs.

Optional
--------
(but you will need a package manager for your Linux distro)

  yum
  rpm
  apt-get
  dpkg

Building and installing
-----------------------

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
