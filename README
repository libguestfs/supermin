supermin - Tool for creating supermin appliances

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances.  These are tiny
appliances [similar to virtual machines], usually around 100KB in
size, which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a
second when you need to boot one of them.

A complete description is in the supermin(1) man page.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF SUPERMIN 4.x: supermin 5.x is a rewrite of
  supermin 4.  It is compatible at a high level with supermin 4 /
  febootstrap 3, but requires some command line adjustments.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF FEBOOTSTRAP 3.x:
  supermin 4.x is just an evolution of febootstrap 3.x (really we just
  renamed it). The previous febootstrap program is now called
  supermin. The previous febootstrap-supermin-helper program is now
  called supermin-helper. Apart from that they are identical, although
  they will evolve and add features over time.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF FEBOOTSTRAP 2.x:
  febootstrap 3.x is a complete rewrite.  febootstrap 2.x could only
  build Fedora distributions.  This version can build many varieties
  of Linux distros.  3.x only builds supermin appliances, it does not
  build chroots.  3.x does not build cross-distro, cross-release or
  cross-architecture systems.  If you want febootstrap 2.x, please use
  the 'febootstrap-2.x' branch from the git repository.

Requirements
------------

  ocaml

  ocaml findlib ("ocamlfind" program)

  perldoc
    - This is just used to generate the manpage.

  static libc

  bash

  gcc

  gawk

  libcom_err
  libext2fs
  /sbin/mke2fs
    - These are part of e2fsprogs.

For Fedora/RHEL:

  rpm
  librpm
  yumdownloader (from yum-utils)

For Debian/Ubuntu:

  dpkg
  apt-get

Optional
--------

These are only needed if you plan to boot the supermin appliances you
are building:

  qemu >= 0.13
  kernel >= 2.6.36

  zlib (statically linked) - if your kernel uses gzipped modules

  xz (statically linked) - if your kernel uses xz-compressed modules

Building and installing
-----------------------

If you're cloning this from git the first time, do:

  ./bootstrap
  ./autogen.sh

For normal builds, and building from the tarball:

  ./configure
  make

You can run supermin without installing:

  ./src/supermin --help

To install the software:

  sudo make install

Tests
-----

  make check

Note that the tests require a network connection.  If you don't
have a network connection (eg. for distro package building) then
try doing:

  ./configure --disable-network-tests

Examples
--------

See the examples/ subdirectory.
